SockyNotifier
=============

Throw a macOS notification when connection attempts to servers on the local host are observed.

This is designed to provide some level of visibility into any activities on your system where local servers
running on Well-Known (and merely well-known, if you catch my drift) ports are being enumerated.

Inspired by the proof of concept of this demonstrated by https://wybiral.github.io/wtf/
